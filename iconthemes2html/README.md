AWK Script for comparing icon themes. It parses *index.theme* file in icon theme folder, finds all icons in all included folders, and creates html files (separated and named by context of icon group) with comparison between themes.<br>How to use:
```
./iconthemes2html.awk [file]... [option]...
```

Files must be correct index.theme files with path.
<br>**Options are:**<br>
**-c** contexts for parsing. Syntax: `-c=Actions,Places,MimeTypes`<br>
**-s** sizes to parse. Syntax: `-s=16,24,32`<br>
**-u** user list of contexts, icons and their descriptions. Syntax: `-u=/path/list`<br>

```
# any comment
Context1 #one word;first letter is Uppercase
Description of context #  must contain spaces
# first - name of an icon w/o spaces or capitals, after <tab> - description of icon.
icon1	Description of icon
