# Caja/Nautilus/Thunar Scripts
Some useful scripts written for myself. Maybe will be useful for you too. Some of them made only for Caja and Nautilus. Maybe I will edit them in future to be compatible with other script-friendly file managers.

## link_sosedi.sh
Bash script. A tool for icon theme makers. it creates relative symlinks in (neighboring to the current) folders to the same targets. Used for Nautilus, Caja and Thunar actions.

The princip of working:<br>
It creates link targeted to "folder.png" with name "folder-closed.png" in folders: theme/places/16, theme/places/22, theme/places/24, theme/places/32 and theme/places/48 at one action.

## linkerator.sh
Bash script. Needs *zenity* as dependence.<br>Turns all of arguments (selected files -- %F in Thunar) to any target you enter in zenity input dialog.

## symlink2file.sh
Converts selected symlinks to it's original targets.<br>
Also can work in command line by syntax: `./symlink2file.sh [file1] [file1]`<br>

# Caja/Nautilus only Scripts:

## lincentrator.sh
Concentrator of links. When you apply it to selected files, it finds all dupes to each selected file. And then converts all dupes to symlinks targeted to it's selected original. For examlpe, you have some duplicates and symlinks of same content in one folder and want one of them to be an original, while others shall be symlinks to it.

Also by default it does incremental saving of it's child script to working directory with collection of it's executions for running all of them in same folders. If you don't want it, then just delete or comment a row: *clone_script "$clone_postfix"* in the script file.

## refresh_thumbs.sh
Deletes thumbnails of selected files. Useful when are broken.<br>Needs *gio* package installed.

## backup.awk
Script for NAUTILUS/CAJA for making dated backups of your files in ~/bak dir with named subdirs by containing folder's name.

## hardlink_to_next_panel.awk

AWK script. Works only with Nautilus and Caja. Makes hardlinks of selected files to next panel in double-panel window of Nautilus or Caja.
